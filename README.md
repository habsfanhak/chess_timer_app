This is an application that uses react native to create a mobile application designed to mimic a chess timer. The application allows users to set a desired time control and play through a match in real life, while keeping track of how much time each player has remaining. The application consists of 3 main screens, being the landing page to select time controls, the page that acts as the timer, and a final page mean to display the result if a player runs out of time.
